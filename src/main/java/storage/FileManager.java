    /* ***IMPORTANT NOTE***
        Reasoning for root file path when generating files:

        Originally I kept the text files in a package called 'files' with the following path:
            "src/files/items.txt"

        This however caused Issues when building to a JAR file as the program could not modify the text files inside itself,
        the solution being to generate them in the same path as the JAR file if they don't exist, hence the creation of
        the FileManager class.

        Having the paths defined in  single location and using the variables elsewhere allows me to change it easily in
        the future if needed.
